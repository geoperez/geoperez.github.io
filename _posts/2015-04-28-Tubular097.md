Check our new version, it's more stable and the [Tubular generator](http://unosquare.github.io/tubular/) is getting just better everyday. 

I'm creating a [Tubular Boilerplate](https://github.com/unosquare/tubular-boilerplate). I hope to publish it in this week. It'll include Bower and CDN approach. Easy to start Tubular, and then, maybe, a Yeoman generator.
